\section*{Industrial context and motivation}
%============================================================%
%============================================================%

The current challenge of energy transition involves, among other things, reducing the share of fossil fuels in the global electricity mix. 
In this context, offshore wind energy offers several advantages \citep{eolien_en_mer_2022}. 
Offshore energy benefits from more consistent winds than onshore, mainly due to the absence of terrain roughness, it also makes possible the installation of larger and more powerful wind turbines. 
Since the construction of the first offshore wind farm in Vindeby, Denmark, in 1991, the industry has experienced rapid growth, with a total worldwide capacity of 56 GW in operation in 2021. 
Over time, offshore wind technology has matured, resulting in significant achievements such as securing projects in Europe through ``zero-subsidy bids'' where the electricity produced is directly sold on the wholesale market \citep{eolien_en_mer_2022}. 

However, despite the progress of this sector, scaling limitations and numerous scientific questions emerge. 
To meet ambitious national and regional development targets, the wind energy industry must address various scaling issues, including port logistics, the critical demand for natural resources, and the lack of sustainable end-of-life processes. 
Furthermore, the field presents scientific challenges that often involve coupling data with numerical simulations of physical systems and their surrounding environment. 
The wind energy community is focused on different objectives, including enhancing the design of floating offshore wind turbines, refining wind resource estimation techniques, and optimizing maintenance operations. 
In general, several decisions are made throughout the lifespan of a wind turbine by its designer, installer, and operator, with only partial knowledge about specific physical phenomena. 
Therefore, modeling and controlling the various sources of uncertainty associated with offshore wind energy could become a key success factor in this highly competitive industry.
%The design of an offshore wind farm depends on multiple site parameters such as the water depth, soil properties, wind, waves and current conditions, and the local community acceptance. 
%Fortunately, international standards regulate this activity and provide general engineering guidelines. 

Overall, the offshore wind industry needs methods for uncertainty management \citep{OWT_review_2016} regarding design safety margins and operational asset management (at the component, wind turbine, and overall wind farm levels). 
For wind project developers, the primary focus is on improving the wind potential assessment of candidate geographic locations by combining various sources of information for modeling the multivariate distribution of environmental conditions. 
In the case of floating wind projects, the goal is to incorporate a probabilistic aspect from the design phase (e.g., of the floaters) to define safer, more robust, and more cost-effective solutions.
For wind farm owners, end-of-life management is another significant concern. 
An owner of a wind farm reaching its end of life has three options: \textit{(i)} extend the operational life of assets, \textit{(ii)} replace current wind turbines with newer models, \textit{(iii)} or decommission and sell the wind farm. 
The first two options require evaluating the structural reliability and residual lifespan, with quantitative assessments reviewed by certification agencies and insurers to issue operating permits. 
To provide a rigorous and quantitative risk assessment, the generic methodology know as the \textit{uncertainty quantification methodology} is a widely accepted approach in industrial sectors facing these types of issues \citep{rocquigny_2008,blanchard_2023}.

\section*{Generic methodology for uncertainty quantification} 
%============================================================%
%============================================================%

The field of computer experiments emerged after the formidable increase of processing power that occurred in the past decades. 
Numerical models can simulate complex system behavior based on initial conditions defined by the analyst. 
They quickly became essential for the analysis, design, and certification of complex systems in cases where experiments or physical measurements are too costly or even unfeasible. 
However, such numerical models are mostly deterministic: the reproducible result of a simulation is associated with a fixed input set of parameters. 
%The issue of managing uncertainties associated with these inputs arises when performing analysis with numerical models. 

Uncertainty quantification aims at modeling and controlling uncertainties around a numerical model. 
To do so, a generic methodology has been proposed to quantify and analyze uncertainties among the input and output variables of a numerical model \citep{rocquigny_2008,blanchard_2023}. 
An overview of the mathematical tools used in this field is provided by \citet{sullivan_2015}. 
This approach challenges the understanding of a system, ultimately contributing to more robust decision-making. 
Figure \ref{fig:UQ_methodo} illustrates the main steps of the generic uncertainty quantification method, which are briefly summarized hereafter: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Step A -- Problem specification}:     
    This step involves identifying the system under study and constructing a numerical model capable of precisely simulating its behavior. 
    Specifying the problem also involves the definition of a set of parameters inherent to the numerical model. 
    These parameters include both the input variables and the output variables generated by the simulation. 
    In this document, the numerical model is considered a black box, in contrast to approaches that are integrated within the numerical solution schemes for the system's behavioral equations (referred to as ``intrusive approaches'' \citealp{lemaitre_2010}). 
    Generally, numerical models are first calibrated against measured data and pass a process of validation and verification to reduce modeling errors (see e.g., \citealp{oberkampf_2010_VVUQ,damblin_2015,carmassi_2018}).  
    \item \textbf{Step B -- Uncertainty modeling}: 
    The objective of this step is to identify and model all sources of uncertainty related to the input variables. 
    Most of the time, uncertainty is modeled in the probabilistic framework \citep{sullivan_2015}, but other approaches could be considered \citep{ajenjo_2023}.
    \item \textbf{Step C -- Uncertainty propagation}:
    This step propagates the uncertain inputs through the computer model.  
    Consequently, the output of the numerical model (commonly scalar) also becomes uncertain. 
    The goal is to estimate a quantity of interest, which is a statistic related to the studied random output variable. 
    The uncertainty propagation method may differ depending on the quantity of interest targeted (e.g., a moment, a quantile, a rare event probability).    
    \item \textbf{Step C' -- Inverse analysis}: 
    In this step, a sensitivity analysis can be performed to study the role allocated to each uncertain input leading to the uncertain output. 
    \item \textbf{Metamodeling}: 
    Considering the high computational cost associated with some simulations, statistical techniques can be used to emulate these expensive simulators with a limited number of simulations. 
    Uncertainty quantification can then be carried out using a ``surrogate model'' (or metamodel) to reduce the computational cost. 
    This optional statistical learning often proves to be essential in practice to perform uncertainty quantification. 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem statement and outline of the thesis}
%============================================================%
%============================================================%

Risk and uncertainty management in the field of wind energy is a significant concern for the electric utility Électricité de France (EDF). 
This motivated the research and development division of EDF to participate in a EU founded project named HIPERWIND\footnotemark~(for ``HIghly advanced Probabilistic design and Enhanced Reliability methods for high-value, cost-efficient offshore wind''). 
\footnotetext{HIPERWIND web page: \url{https://www.hiperwind.eu/}}
Collaborating with various partners from the academic sector (such as DTU, ETH Zurich, University of Bergen) and the industrial domain (such as DNV, IFPEN, EPRI) brought different perspectives on this topic. 
As a result, this thesis aims to adapt and apply the generic uncertainty quantification methodology to industrial offshore wind energy design and operation. 
In particular to assess the structural integrity with respect to fatigue damage (caused by a large number of small amplitude solicitations). 
As such, this use case raises scientific challenges related to its specific characteristics, described in the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The numerical model exploited in the present work consists of a serie of numerical models executed sequentially. 
    This chain is divided into three parts: first, stochastic wind and wave velocity spatio-temporal fields are generated, 
    then the coupled hydro-aero-servo-elastic behavior of the wind turbine is simulated, 
    and finally these data are post-processed to obtain scalar quantities of interest. 
    \item The complexity of this simulator, along with the high unit computational cost (about 40 minutes per simulation), requires efficient sampling methods and high-performance computing systems. 
    \item In addition to the complexity associated with the numerical model, modeling the input uncertainties also represents a challenge. 
    Indeed, the joint distribution associated with environmental conditions (measured in situ) presents a complex dependence structure.   
    The quality of the inference step is critical as it directly impacts the conclusions of uncertainty propagation.
\end{itemize}

In order to apply the generic methodology for uncertainty quantification to the offshore wind turbine case, this thesis aims to answer the following questions: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{Q1.}] \textit{
    How to accurately model the dependence structure associated with the joint environmental distribution? 
    } (\ding{238} Step B)
    \item[\textbf{Q2.}] \textit{
    How to perform uncertainty propagation through a computationally expensive numerical chain uniquely based on an empirical description (measured data) of input uncertainties?
    } (\ding{238} Step C)
    \item[\textbf{Q3.}] \textit{
    How to estimate rare event probabilities related to the fatigue failure of offshore wind turbine structures?
    } (\ding{238} Step C)
    \item[\textbf{Q4.}] \textit{
    How to study the sensitivity of uncertain inputs regarding quantities of interest resulting from structural reliability (i.e., reliability-oriented sensitivity analysis)? 
    } (\ding{238} Step C')
\end{itemize}

To propose an answer to these questions, this manuscript is divided into three parts. 
The first part recalls the principal tools for uncertainty quantification and introduces offshore wind turbine modeling and design. 
The second part presents the contributions of this thesis associated to uncertainty quantification and propagation while the third part describes the contributions to rare event estimation. 
This manuscript is divided into seven chapters, which are summarized hereafter: 

\paragraph{Chapter 1 -- Uncertainty quantification in computer experiments.} 
%------------------------------------------------------------%
This chapter gives a brief over-view of various topics in uncertainty quantification \citep{sullivan_2015}. 
After a reminder of some mathematical concepts, the model specification step is described, considering a black box and its input and output variables. 
The different types and sources of uncertainties are then presented, along with their modeling within a probabilistic framework. 
Uncertainty propagation depends on the estimated quantities of interest, therefore, one section addresses propagation methods for central tendency studies, and another focuses on risk and reliability analysis. 
The section dedicated to central tendency presents numerical integration, sampling, and design of experiment methods \citep{fang_liu_2018}. 
The one about rare event probabilities introduces usual methods from the field of structural reliability \citep{lemaire_2009,MorioBalesdent2015}. 

This chapter also covers the main methods for global sensitivity analysis \citep{daveiga_iooss_2021}. 
In general terms, this field divides its methods into two major classes: screening methods and importance measures. 
Screening techniques are typically applied in high-dimensional problems and aim to identify variables with low impact on the variability of the output of interest. 
Importance measures, on the other hand, quantitatively allocate, for each input variable, a share of the output variability, enabling the ranking of variables based on their influence.

Finally, this chapter presents an overview of the families of surrogate models commonly used in uncertainty quantification \citep{forrester_2008}. 
Special attention is given to Gaussian process regression, which consists in conditioning a Gaussian process on a set of observations from the numerical model. 
Once conditioned, the Gaussian process simultaneously offers a surrogate model (mean of the Gaussian process, also called predictor) and an error function (variance of the process). 
Some iterative methods (called ``active'') use this additional information to progressively enrich the surrogate model and improve its predictability. 
These techniques were quite successful in the 1990s for solving optimization problems with expensive functions \citep{jones_1998}. 
Since then, their use has expanded to solve structural reliability problems \citep{echard_2011}.


\paragraph{Chapter 2 -- Introduction to wind turbine modeling and design.} 
%------------------------------------------------------------%
Simulating an offshore wind turbine involves modeling multiple physical aspects interacting with random environmental conditions. 
This chapter first introduces spectral methods used to generate wind and wave velocity fields by applying inverse Fourier transforms (e.g., as implemented in the TurbSim tool \citealp{turbsim_2009}). 
These simulated wind velocity fields then become the inputs of a multi-physics wind turbine numerical model. 
Such simulation includes simplified modeling of the interactions between fluids and structures (using e.g., the blade element momentum theory), dynamic modeling of the structure using flexible multibody methods, and modeling of wind turbine control systems \citep{burton_2021_wind_handbook}. 
The numerical code studied generates a time series of several physical quantities describing the system's behavior.

This thesis particularly focuses on the probabilistic evaluation of fatigue damage in wind turbine structures. 
Fatigue damage is a phenomenon that deteriorates the mechanical properties of a material as a result of exposure to many low-amplitude cyclic stresses. 
Currently, wind energy standards recommend the use of deterministic safety factors to address this failure mode \citep{dnv_loads_2016,iec_2019}. 
A probabilistic approach can enhance the analysis and might sometimes reveal conservative safety margins, as addressed in various methodological works \citep{huchet_2019,lataniotis_2019,petrovska_2022}.

In this context, this chapter enumerates the input variables of the calculation chain that are considered uncertain. 
These variables are grouped into two groups: those related to the environment (e.g., average wind speed, wind speed standard deviation, wind direction, significant wave height, wave period, and wave direction), 
and those related to the system (e.g., controller wind misalignment error, soil stiffness, fatigue calculation curve parameters).


\paragraph{Chapter 3 -- Kernel-based uncertainty quantification.} 
%------------------------------------------------------------%
This chapter examines perturbations in environmental conditions within an offshore wind farm induced by wake effects \citep{larsen_2008_wake}. 
A theoretical offshore wind farm off the southern coast of Brittany is considered as a use case, and a simplified numerical model of wake in this wind farm is used. 
This model provides an analytical prediction of the wind speed deficit and turbulence created by the wake, taking into account the influence of the floaters' positions due to rigid body dynamics. 

In the second phase, uncertainty propagation is carried out through the wake model, considering the joint distribution of ambient environmental conditions as inputs. 
In the end, an environmental distribution perturbed by the wake is simulated for each wind turbine. 
A dissimilarity measure between distributions, based on kernels and named ``maximum mean discrepancy'' (MMD), is used to compare the distributions perceived by each wind turbine. 
This measure allows the clustering of wind turbines exposed to similar environmental conditions, resulting in identical structural responses. 
Given the high computational cost of aero-servo-hydro-elastic simulations for offshore wind turbines, this preliminary study allows to assess the reliability analysis at the wind farm scale without repeating the analysis for each turbine. 
Ultimately, only four classes are selected to represent a wind farm of 25 turbines.


\paragraph{Chapter 4 -- Kernel-based central tendency estimation.} 
%------------------------------------------------------------%
This chapter presents the use of the MMD (introduced in the previous chapter) in the context of probability distribution sampling, a method known as ``kernel herding'' introduced by \citet{chen_welling_2010}. 
This quadrature technique belongs to the family of ``Bayesian quadratures'' \citet{briol_oates_2019}, which can be viewed as a generalization of quasi-Monte Carlo methods \citep{hickernell_2020}. 

The properties of this method are highlighted through an industrial application dedicated to estimating the mean fatigue damage of a wind turbine structure. 
Although this quantity is crucial in the design and certification of wind turbines, the methods used by standards to estimate it are known to be suboptimal (i.e., regular grids). 
The study is conducted on a model of a fixed offshore wind turbine belonging to a farm in the North Sea. 
Uncertainties in input environmental conditions are inferred from in-situ measured data. 

Finally, a numerical comparison with Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling reveals the performance and practical advantages of kernel herding. 
Overall, this method allows for direct subsampling from a large environmental database without the need for inference (step B).


\paragraph{Chapter 5 -- Kernel-based surrogate model validation.} 
%------------------------------------------------------------%
This chapter proposes the use of kernel-based sampling methods in the context of model validation for machine learning (or surrogate models). 
Estimating the predictivity of supervised learning models requires an evaluation of the learned surrogate model on a set of test points that were not used during training. 
The quality of the validation naturally depends on the properties of the test set and the metric used to summarize the prediction error. 
This contribution first suggests using space-filling sampling methods to ``optimally'' select a test set, then, 
it introduces a new predictivity coefficient that weights the observed errors to improve the global error estimation. 
A numerical comparison between several sampling methods based on geometric approaches \citep{shang_apley_2020} or kernel methods \citep{chen_welling_2010,mak_joseph_2018} is carried out. 
Our results show that weighted versions of kernel methods offer superior performance. 
An application to simulated mechanical loads in an offshore wind turbine model is also presented. 
This experiment illustrates the practical relevance of this technique as an effective alternative to costly cross-validation techniques.

\paragraph{Chapter 6 -- Adaptive rare event estimation using Bernstein copula.} 
%------------------------------------------------------------%
Estimating rare event probabilities is a common issue in industrial risk management, especially in the field of structural reliability \citep{MorioBalesdent2015}. 
To overcome the well-known limitations of the Monte Carlo method, several techniques have been proposed
Among them, ``subset simulation'' \citep{AuBeck2001} is a technique based on the split of a rare probability into a product of less rare (and thus easier to estimate) conditional probabilities associated with nested failure events. 
However, this technique relies on conditional simulation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. 
In practice, these algorithms produce correlated chains which converge asymptotically towards the targeted distribution. 
The issue in reliability analysis is that their convergence is usually not checked (e.g., \citealp{roy_2020_mcmc_convergence} reviews diagnostic tools for MCMC).    
In this chapter, another method using an adaptive importance sampling structure is proposed \citep{zhang_1996_NIS}, with the advantage of preserving the i.i.d. property. 
Independent sampling is particularly relevant for reusing these samples in a posterior reliability-oriented sensitivity analysis. 
The algorithm introduced is based on the nonparametric inference of the conditional joint distribution using kernel density estimation of marginals combined with dependence inference using the empirical Bernstein copula \citep{sancetta_satchell_2004}. 
The so-called ``Bernstein adaptive nonparametric conditional sampling'' (BANCS), is compared to the subset simulation method for several structural reliability problems. 
The first results are promising, and various perspectives could still improve this technique.

After proposing a new method for reliability analysis, this chapter deals with sensitivity analysis for risk measures (e.g., rare event probabilities). 
Global sensitivity analysis \citep{daveiga_iooss_2021} assigns a portion of the global output variability to each variable (or group of variables), often using a functional decomposition of the output variance. 
However, when studying risk measures (often located in the distributions' tails), the global sensitivity results might be very different from the sensitivity to the risk measure. 
``Reliability-oriented sensitivity analysis'' (\abv{rosa}), studies the impact of the inputs in regard to a risk measure such as a rare event probability (see e.g., \citealp{chabridon_2018_thesis}). 
Using the nested subsets obtained with the BANCS algorithm (presented in the previous chapter), the idea here is to study the ROSA evolution as the subsets get closer to the failure domain. 
For each subset, a ROSA is carried out with a kernel-based importance measure called the ``Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion'' adapted to this context \citep{daveiga_2015,marrel_chabridon_2021}. 

\paragraph{Chapter 7 -- Application to wind turbine fatigue reliability and robustness.} 
%------------------------------------------------------------%
This chapter proposes a fully probabilistic reliability analysis of an offshore wind turbine's monopile foundation. 
Considering a set of variables related to the system, a surrogate model of the lifetime fatigue damage is built on a learning set gathering over $10^5$ simulations of the offshore wind turbine.  
This huge computational effort was made possible by deploying a wrapper of the simulator on a high-performance computer.   
Using the surrogate model to emulate the costly wind turbine model, a nominal reliability analysis is performed. 
To complete this analysis, the robustness of the failure probability obtained is assessed by perturbating the inputs' distributions. 
This approach called the ``perturbed-law based sensitivity indices'' \citep{lemaitre_2015_PLI} reveals that the resistance variable has a primary role on the reliability.
