\chapter{Dissimilarity measures between probability distributions}
\label{apx:B}
%*******************************************************************************

Beyond the concept of discrepancy presented in Section~\ref{sec:central_propagation} to measure a distance to uniformity, this Appendix introduces two families of measures commonly used to quantify the dissimilarity between two probability distributions $\pi$ and $\zeta$.

\section*{Csiz\'{a}r $f$-divergences}
%============================================================%
%============================================================%

The general definition of the ``$f$-divergence'' of $\pi$ from $\zeta$, also called Cisz\'{a}r $f$-divergence after the seminal work of \citet{csiszar_1964}, is given by: 
\begin{equation}
    D_{f}\left(\pi || \zeta\right) = \int_{\Omega} f\left(\frac{\dd \pi}{\dd \zeta}\right) \, \dd \zeta, 
\end{equation}
where $f(\cdot)$ is a convex function such that $f(1)=0$, and where $\pi$ is absolutely continuous w.r.t. $\zeta$. 
Let us recall some well-known divergences which are special cases of $f$-divergences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kullback–Leibler \citep{kullback_1951}: $f(t)=t \, \ln(t)$;
    \item Hellinger distance \citep{jeffreys_1946}: $f(t)=(\sqrt{t} - 1)^2$;
    \item Total variation: $f(t)= |t-1|$.
\end{itemize} 
The reader may refer to \citet{basu_2011} for further details on $f$-divergences.

\section*{Integral probability metrics}
%============================================================%
%============================================================%

Another family of dissimilarity measures between probability distributions called the ``integral probability metrics'' \citep{muller_1997_ipm}, is defined as: 
\begin{equation}
    \gamma_{\iH}(\pi, \zeta) = \sup_{g \in \iH} \left | \int_{\iD_{\bX}} g(\bx) \dd \pi(\bx) - \int_{\iD_{\bX}} g(\bx) \dd \zeta(\bx) \right|,
    \label{eq:ipm}  
\end{equation}
where $\iH$ is a class of measurable functions on $\iD_{\bX} \subset \R^d$ that sets the type of integral probability metric.   
For example, the total variation distance considers all the functions with value in $[-1, 1]$; 
furthermore, the Wasserstein distance relies on a class of bounded Lipschitz functions; 
then a kernel-based distance called the ``maximum mean discrepancy'' (MMD) uses a specific Hilbert space. 

Between the wide panel of distances\footnotemark, a particular focus is dedicated in this section to the MMD. 
This distance was successfully used in diverse contexts for the consistency of its estimators, and its closed-form expression (allowing exact computation in some cases, see \citealp{sriperumbudur_2012}).

\subsection*{Kernel discrepancy}
%------------------------------------------------------------%

This section first introduces a kernel-based discrepancy called the maximum mean discrepancy, generalizing the concept of discrepancy to non-uniform measures.

\paragraph{Reproducing kernel Hilbert space and kernel mean embedding}
%------------------------------------------------------------%
Let us first assume that the function $g$ belongs in a specific function space $\iH(k)$. 
$\iH(k)$ is a \emph{reproducing kernel Hilbert space} (RKHS), which is an inner product space of functions $g:\iD_{\bX} \rightarrow \R$. 
Considering a symmetric and positive definite function $k: \iD_{\bX} \times \iD_{\bX} \rightarrow \R$, later called a ``reproducing kernel'' or simply a ``kernel'', an RKHS verifies the following axioms: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ``feature map'' $\phi : \iD_{\bX} \to \iH(k); \phi(\bx) = k(\cdot, \bx)$ belongs to the RKHS: $k(\cdot, \bx) \in \iH(k), \forall \bx \in \iD_{\bX}$;
    \item The ``reproducing property'': $\langle g, k(\cdot, \bx) \rangle_{\iH(k)} = g(\bx), \quad \forall \bx \in \iD_{\bX}, \forall g \in \iH(k)$.
\end{itemize}
Note that it can be shown that every positive semi-definite kernel defines a unique RKHS (and vice versa) with a feature map $\phi$, such that $k(\bx, \bx') = \langle \phi(\bx), \phi(\bx') \rangle_{\iH(k)}$.
This framework allows us to embed a continuous or discrete probability measure in an RKHS, as illustrated in \fig{fig:kernel_mean_embedding}. 
For any measure $\pi$, let us define its \emph{kernel mean embedding} \citep{sejdinovic_2013}, also called ``potential'' $P_{\pi}(\bx)$ in \cite{pronzato_zhigljavsky_2020}, associated with the kernel $k$ as:

\begin{equation}
   P_{\pi}(\bx) = \int_{\iD_{\bX}} k(\bx, \bx') \dd \pi(\bx').
\end{equation}

Respectively, the potential $P_{\zeta_n}(\bx)$ of a discrete distribution $\zeta_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \delta(\bx^{(i)}), w_i \in \R$ associated with the kernel $k$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:potential}
    %P_{\pi}(\bx) = \int_{\iD_{\bX}} k(\bx, \bx') \d \pi(\bx'), \qquad 
    P_{\zeta_n}(\bx) =  \int_{\iD_{\bX}} k(\bx, \bx') \dd \zeta_n(\bx') = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i k(\bx, \bx^{(i)}).
\end{equation}
The potential $P_{\pi}(\bx)$ of the targeted measure $\pi$ will be referred to as ``target potential'' and the potential $P_{\zeta_n}(\bx)$ associated with the discrete distribution $\zeta_n$ called ``current potential'' when its support is the current design $\bX_n$. 
When $P_{\zeta_n}(\bx)$ is close to $P_{\pi}(\bx)$, it can be interpreted as $\zeta_n$ being an adequate quantization or representation of $\pi$. %(which leads to a good estimation of a quantity such as $I_{\pi}(g)$ from \eq{eq:quadrature_rule}). 
Potentials can be computed in closed forms for specific pairs of distributions and associated kernels. 
Summary tables of some of these cases are detailed in \cite[Sec. 3.4]{briol_phd_2019}, \cite[Sec. 4]{pronzato_zhigljavsky_2020}, and extended in \cite{fekhari_iooss_2023}. 
However, in most cases, the target potentials must be estimated on a large and representative sample, typically a large quasi-Monte Carlo sample of $\pi$.


The \emph{energy} of a measure $\pi$ is defined as the integral of the potential $P_\pi$ against the measure, which leads to the following scalar quantity:
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon_\pi= \int_{\iD_{\bX}} P_{\pi}(\bx) \dd \pi(\bx) = \iint_{\iD_{\bX}^2} k(\bx, \bx')\, \dd\pi(\bx) \dd\pi(\bx').
    \label{eq:target_energy}
\end{equation}

    \caption{Kernel mean embedding of a continuous and discrete probability distribution.}
    \label{fig:kernel_mean_embedding}
\end{figure}
Finally, using the reproducing property and writing the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the absolute quadrature error leads to the following inequality, similar to the Koksma-Hlawka inequality introduced in Theorem~\ref{thm:koksma_inequality} (see \citealp{briol_oates_2019}): 

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i g(\bx^{(i)}) - \int_{\iD_{\bX}} g(\bx) \dd \pi(\bx) \right| &= \left| \left\langle g, P_{\zeta_n}(\bx) \right\rangle_{\iH(k)} - \left\langle g, P_{\pi}(\bx) \right\rangle_{\iH(k)} \right| \\
    &= \left| \left\langle g, \left(P_{\zeta_n}(\bx) - P_{\pi}(\bx)\right) \right\rangle_{\iH(k)} \right|\\
    &\leq \lVert g \lVert_{\iH(k)}  \left\lVert P_{\pi}(\bx) - P_{\zeta_n}(\bx) \right\lVert_{\iH(k)}.
    \label{eq:quad_error}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\paragraph{Maximum mean discrepancy}
%------------------------------------------------------------%
A metric of discrepancy is offered by the MMD. 
This distance between two probability distributions $\pi$ and $\zeta$ is given by the worst-case error for any function within a unit ball of the Hilbert space $\iH(k)$, associated with the kernel $k$:
\begin{equation}
    \MMD(\pi, \zeta) = %\\ 
    \sup_{\lVert g \lVert_{\iH(k)} \leq 1}
            \left | \int_{\iD_{\bX}} g(\bx) \dd \pi(\bx) - \int_{\iD_{\bX}} g(\bx) \dd \zeta(\bx) \right| %= \left\lVert P_{\pi}(\bx) - P_{\zeta}(\bx) \right\lVert_{\iH(k)}.
    \label{eq:mmd_c4}  
\end{equation}

According to the inequality in \eq{eq:quad_error}, $\MMD(\pi, \zeta) = \left\lVert P_{\pi} - P_{\zeta} \right\lVert_{\iH(k)}$, meaning that the MMD fully relies on the difference of potentials. 
Moreover, \cite{sriperumbudur_2010} defines a kernel as ``characteristic kernel'' when the following equivalence is true: $\MMD(\pi, \zeta) = 0 \Leftrightarrow \pi = \zeta$. 
This property makes the MMD a metric on $\iD_{\bX}$. 
The squared MMD has been used for various purposes such as statistical testing \citep{gretton_2006}, numerical integration \citep{chen_welling_2010}, and global sensitivity analysis \citep{daveiga_2015}. 
It can be written as follows:

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \MMD^2(\pi, \zeta) &= \left\lVert P_{\pi}(\bx) - P_{\zeta}(\bx) \right\lVert^2_{\iH(k)}\\
        &= \left\langle \left(P_{\pi}(\bx) - P_{\zeta}(\bx) \right), \left(P_{\pi}(\bx) - P_{\zeta}(\bx) \right) \right\rangle_{\iH(k)}\\
        &= \left\langle P_{\pi}(\bx), P_{\pi}(\bx) \right\rangle_{\iH(k)} - 2 \left\langle P_{\pi}(\bx), P_{\zeta}(\bx) \right\rangle_{\iH(k)} + \left\langle P_{\zeta}(\bx), P_{\zeta}(\bx) \right\rangle_{\iH(k)}\\
        &= \iint_{\iD_{\bX}^2} k(\bx, \bx')\, \dd\pi(\bx) \dd\pi(\bx') - 2 \iint_{\iD_{\bX}^2} k(\bx, \bx')\, \dd\pi(\bx) \dd\zeta(\bx') + \iint_{\iD_{\bX}^2} k(\bx, \bx')\, \dd\zeta(\bx) \dd\zeta(\bx').
        \label{eq:mmd_integral}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Taking a discrete distribution with uniform weights $\zeta_n= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta(\bx^{(i)})$, the squared MMD reduces to: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mmd_design}
    \MMD^2(\pi, \zeta_n) = \varepsilon_\pi - \frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n P_{\pi}\left(\bx^{(i)}\right) + \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{i, j=1}^n k\left(\bx^{(i)}, \bx^{(j)}\right).
\end{equation}

\paragraph*{Analytical computation of potentials for Mat\'ern kernels}
%------------------------------------------------------------%
According to \eq{eq:mmd_integral}, the computation of the MMD moslty relies on the expression of potentials. 
For most of the distributions $\pi$ studied, the potentials are estimated on a candidate set with size $N$ such that $P_\pi(\bx) \approx \frac1N \sum_{i=1}^N k\left(\bx^{(i)}, \bx\right)$, which forces us to manipulate heavy covariance matrices. 
However, for specific combinations of distributions and kernels, one can directly express the potential function analytically. 
If $\pi$ is the uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$, a summary of analytical potentials for various kernels is proposed in \citet[Table 1]{pronzato_zhigljavsky_2020}. 
This section develops the analytical expression of the potential, in the case of standard normal distributions with Matérn kernels (with $\eta=5/2$).

The analytical potential is expressed hereafter in the one-dimensional case, in a higher dimension, it is the product of one-dimensional potentials (similarly to tensor-product kernels). 
When $\pi$ is the uniform on $[0,1]$ and $k$ is a Matérn kernelwith smoothness $\nu=5/2$ and correlation length $\theta$ (see \eqref{eq:Matern5/2}), the potential $P_{\pi}$ is defined as:
\bea
    P_{\pi}(x) = \frac{16 \theta}{3 \sqrt{5}} - \frac{1}{15 \theta} (S_\theta(x) + S_\theta(1-x)),
\eea
where
\bea
\nonumber
    S_\theta(x) = 
    \exp\left(- \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\theta} x \right) 
    \left( 5 \sqrt{5} x^2 + 25 \theta x + 8 \sqrt{5} \theta^2 \right).
\eea
For other Matérn kernels with $\nu=1/2$ and $\nu=3/2$, similar results can be found in \citet{pronzato_zhigljavsky_2020}. 

When $\pi$ is the standard normal distribution, and $k$ is a Matérn kernel with smoothness $\nu=5/2$ and correlation length $\theta$, the potential $P_{\pi}$ is defined as $P_{\pi}(x) = T_\theta(x) + T_\theta(-x)$, where:
\bea
T_\theta(x) &=&
    \frac{1}{6} 
    \left( 
        \frac{5}{\theta^2} x^2 + 
        \left( 3 - \frac{10}{\theta^2} \right) \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\theta} x + \frac{5}{\theta^2} \left( \frac{5}{\theta^2} -2 \right) + 3
    \right) \\
    && \times\, \mathrm{erfc} \left( \frac{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{\theta} - x}{\sqrt{2}} \right)
    \exp\left(\frac{5}{2 \theta^2} - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\theta}x\right) + \frac{1}{3 \sqrt{2 \pi}} \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\theta} 
    \left( 3 - \frac{5}{\theta^2} \right) \exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{2}\right). 
\eea
